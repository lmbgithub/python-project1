    "This is a simple example of creating and consuming a distributable Python package. \n",

    "# Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "- `camera-simulator` contains a project directory for a Python package. Note that its only content is the `camera-simulator/src` directory for now. If you wanted to add tests or something you could put those in `camera-simulator/tests` or something.\n",
    "- `camera-simulator/src/camera-simulator` is the actual \"package\". In accordance with Python's [documented behavior](https://docs.python.org/3.9/tutorial/modules.html#tut-packages), the directory is a package because it contains an `__init__.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I install and use a package in Development Mode?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Development Mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html) installs the package in \"editable\" mode so that you can change the source for your package in the actual source directory and consuming Python scripts/applications will see your edits the next time they run. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I Package/Bundle/Zip/Prepare my source code into a distributable package that I can distribute to others to use in their own Python apps?\n",
    "\n",
    "Run `python -m build` to prepare your package source code for distribution. This will deploy a distributable Python package into `camera_simulator/src/dist/camera_simulator-0.0.1.tar.gz`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do other users install the package once it's built?\n",
    "\n",
    "Other users can run `pip install camera_simulator-0.0.1.tar.gz` to install your package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can [upload your built package to PyPI](https://packaging.python.org/distributing/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi) and then they can install it by running `pip install camera_simulator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the differences between \"Python Packages\" and eggs?\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been trying to figure that out myself. I can tell you that eggs appear to [essentially be deprecated](https://packaging.python.org/discussions/wheel-vs-egg/) and as noted on the previously linked python.org site _Wheel is currently considered the standard for built and binary packaging for Python._ Therefore I no longer maintain an example of building eggs, but some docs you might find interesting are as follows: \"Python Packages\" are documented at https://packaging.python.org/distributing/ and Eggs are documented at http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs\n",
    "\n",
    "# Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "## After installing the package I still see the error 'ImportError: No module named Camera Simulator' when trying to use it in a script/app.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that the `setup.py` is in the **parent** of the actual root package folder. If you don't do this you won't get any errors, and pip will show you're package as installed (e.g. with `pip show Camera Simulator`) but consuming scripts of the package won't ever find the package and will always get the `ImportError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this also implies that the \"package\" isn't what you specify as the name of your package in `setup.py`. Although `pip` uses the name in `setup.py` to determine whether it is installed, Python itself only cares about the directory that contains the `__init__.py` file."
